"# Twiter-Disaster-Tweets-Analysis" 
In times of disaster, Twitter has become a crucial communication route. Because cellphones are
so widely available, users may report an emergency in real time. As a result, more agencies are
interested in monitoring Twitter programmatically (i.e. disaster relief organizations and news
agencies). However, it is not always evident if a person's statements are announcing a tragedy.
In this project, I have used a dataset of 10,000 hand-classified tweets from kaggle [1]. In this
project, I am attempting to create a best machine learning model that predicts which tweets are
about actual disasters and which aren't.
